Hydraulic Orbital Swimming Emulator (H.O.S.E.)

Treading water in micro-gravity

H.O.S.E. is a device to excercise in a fluid without getting wet. The
initial idea was to just have a tank filled with water and a lid
connected to a rubber pant as depicted in the following picture:

Discussing about how to increase the efficiency of the work-out in this
device, we had the idea to add corn starch to the recipe. Mixed into the
water, the liquid becomes non-newtonian which means the faster the
astronaut moves his legs, the harder it gets for him to move, so the
difficulty automatically adapts. Additionally, the mixing ratio of water
and corn-starch could be varied to adjust the difficulty of the device.

Advantages of the solution:

    optimized weight: parts that need to be brought to the ISS can be
relatively leight-weight
    optimized space usage: the device also acts as water storage tank
    water is already available, device could be connected to the
stations water recycling system

Additional ideas:

    change handles to a rail that goes around the water tank
    add VR to the device to allow swimming your favourite envrionment
    different temperatures can be applied to the water to induce
additional effects

Resources used:

No NASA resource have been used for this project.

The following resource would be required to actually build the device:

    watertank with handles
    water (can be used from the stations water circuit)
    rubber pants
    optional: corn starch (to make the fluid non-newtonian)
